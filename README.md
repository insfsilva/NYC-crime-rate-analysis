# NYC-crime-rate-analysis
The project involved a comprehensive analysis of crime occurrences in NYC, unveiling significant insights into temporal trends and seasonal patterns. Initial observations highlighted a progressive increase in criminal tendencies over time, with distinct spikes in crime rates observed in January and June, and a notable drop in February, indicating a strong seasonal rhythm.  The project emphasized the importance of selecting appropriate model parameters for precise predictions and underscored the inherent unpredictability of forecasting crime rates due to multifaceted external factors such as economic changes and shifts in social dynamics, which were not deeply explored within the report's scope.
